# UCP Technical Committee Meeting - 2026-02-04

**Led by:** Amit Handa

## Attendance
* **Present:** Amit Handa, Ilya Grigorik, Maxime Najim, Daniel Wyckoff, Naga Malepati, Imran Hoosain, Anurag Sinha, Chris Sauve, Ryan Cheung, Guillaume Verdier

## 1. Review of Action Items from previous meeting
* [x] Publish Minutes Proposal (Guillaume Verdier) - *Status: Done*
* [ ] Catalog Capability Final Review (Amit Handa) - *Status: In Progress*

## 2. Technical Decisions & Consensus
* **Topic:** Multi-Item Lookup in Catalog Capability
    * **Discussion:** Evaluated GET (single-item) vs. POST (multi-item) implementation. Agreed that a single POST method using an array of IDs simplifies context handling (country, currency) and protocol consistency.
    * **Decision:** Approved via consensus to model lookup solely as a POST request.
    * **Context:** [#55 feat(catalog): Catalog capability for product discovery](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/55)

* **Topic:** Omit Checkout ID and Deprecation Process
    * **Discussion:** Discussed removing `checkout_id`. Agreed that straight removal is a breaking change and a formal deprecation process is required.
    * **Decision:** Field will be marked as `deprecated` rather than removed immediately. Tooling will also be updated to handle deprecated fields.
    * **Context:** [#145 fix!: Omit checkout id from update requests](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/pull/145)

* **Topic:** Governance Automation & New Repository
    * **Discussion:** Proposal to create a shared repository for cross-repo configs (Code of Conduct, Linters) and implement PR triage via GitHub Code Owners.
    * **Decision:** Approved creation of [new shared repo](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/.github) and migration to automated PR assignment.

## 3. Open Discussions & TC PR Reviews
* **Topic:** Tender-Based Discounts (Target RedCard Use Case)
    * **Notes:** Discussed the need to display 5% discounts and free shipping upstream before order placement. Concerns raised by Target and Google regarding credential validation "chicken and egg" problems (platforms often don't share card bins until submission). A further deep dive discussion will be scheduled to break the problem down, and come up with a proposal for each piece.

* **Topic:** Risk and Abuse Signals
    * **Notes:** Ilya Grigorik proposed a "signals" object and a new non-user-facing `hint` message type to provide metadata (IP, Device ID) to reduce transaction friction. Amit Handa noted the Google team that owns risk signals will review offline. This topic will be revisited in the next TC meeting.

* **Topic:** Request/Response Signatures
    * **Notes:** Identified ambiguity in definition of Request-Signature, and inconsistencies between MCP and REST transports. Currently blocking Target/Gemini integration. A follow-up deep dive was scheduled for later this week to come to an agreement on a path forward.

## 4. New Action Items
* [ ] **Amit Handa:** Schedule deeper-dive breakout sessions for Tender-Based Discounts and Risk/Abuse signals with relevant Risk/Payments teams. (Due: 2026-02-11)
* [ ] **Guillaume Verdier:** Populate the specific list of maintainers in the governance document for TC sanity check. (Due: 2026-02-06)
* [ ] **Ilya Grigorik:** Update Catalog PR to model lookups as POST and spec out a major refactor proposal for request/response signatures. (Due: 2026-02-11)
* [ ] **Daniel Wyckoff:** Push local updates for UCP schema binary to support `@deprecated` annotations. (Due: 2026-02-07)
* [ ] **Ryan Cheung:** Coordinate with Daniel Wyckoff on the versioning process for the `Omit checkout ID` PR. (Due: 2026-02-07)
